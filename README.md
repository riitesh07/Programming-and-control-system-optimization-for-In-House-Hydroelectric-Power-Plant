# Programming and control system optimization for In-House Hydroelectric Power Plant Setup  
The idea here is to program controls for a very CRUDE hydroelectric power plant. We start with a base program that simulates a changing environment and manages our analog input signals accordingly. Our job is to write a program that incorporates these signals and controls various analog and digital devices in order to run the system with a safe and stable process. We also want to create an HMI that will allow the Operator to interact easily and effectively with our system.

I have been using the PLC IEC-61131-3 language such as:  
- FBD - Function Block Diagram
- LD - Ladder Diagram

CPU : Siemens S7-1511 F-1 PN __[Fail safe CPU]  
HMI : WinCC RT advanced

Inputs:-
1.
